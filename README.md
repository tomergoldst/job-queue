# JobQueue
Persisted job queue for android.

Manage your jobs flow by working with a queue. You can create as many queues as you need

Light and easy to use

## Dependency
Add a dependency to your app build.gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.tomergoldst.android:jobqueue:2.0.1'
}
```

## Instructions

Init JobQueue at your application class onCreate()
```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        JobQueue.initialize(this);
    }
}
```

add a job to queue:
```java
final String NETWORK_QUEUE = "network_queue"
JobTask jobTask = new JobTask("myJobName", "myJobData")
JobQueue.add(NETWORK_QUEUE, jobTask);
```

pop next job:
```java
JobTask jobTask = JobQueue.pop(NETWORK_QUEUE);
```

peek on next job:
```java
JobTask jobTask = JobQueue.peek(NETWORK_QUEUE);
```

remove job from queue:
```java
JobQueue.remove(jobTask);
```

remove all jobs from queue:
```java
JobQueue.clearQueue(NETWORK_QUEUE);
```

get all jobs on queue:
```java
List<JobTask> jobs = JobQueue.getJobs(NETWORK_QUEUE);
```

get all jobs of the same task on queue:
```java
List<JobTask> jobs = JobQueue.getJob(NETWORK_QUEUE, "myJobName");
```

get queue size:
```java
long size = JobQueue.size(NETWORK_QUEUE);
```
